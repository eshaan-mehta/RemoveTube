## üîß Technical Details

### Content Analysis Methods

1. **Browser-Based AI Classification**:
   - Uses DistilBERT and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 models via Transformers.js
   - Hierarchical classification: title first, then full content
   - Semantic similarity matching for better topic understanding
   - Runs completely offline in your browser

2. **Keyword Matching** (fallback):
   - Simple but effective keyword-based filtering
   - Automatic fallback if AI models fail to load
   - Matches topics against video titles and descriptions

### Privacy & Security

- **Complete Privacy**: All AI processing happens in your browser - no external API calls
- **Local Storage**: All settings stored locally in Chrome's storage
- **No Data Collection**: Extension doesn't collect, store, or transmit any personal data
- **Offline Operation**: Works completely offline once models are loaded
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for transparency

## üìä Statistics & Insights

Track your productivity with built-in statistics:

- **Daily Counts**: Videos blocked and allowed today
- **Total Counts**: Lifetime statistics
- **Streak Counter**: Days of consistent usage
- **Topic Insights**: See which topics are most commonly matched

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Strict vs. Relaxed Mode

- **Strict Mode**: Blocks videos when classification confidence is low
- **Relaxed Mode**: Allows videos with uncertain classification
- **Recommendation**: Start with strict mode, adjust based on your needs

### Custom Topic Strategies

- **Broad Topics**: Use general terms like "education" for wider coverage
- **Specific Topics**: Use precise terms like "JavaScript programming" for focused filtering
- **Multiple Approaches**: Combine both broad and specific topics for balanced filtering

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not working on YouTube:**
- Refresh the YouTube page after installation
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Ensure you've completed the initial setup

**Videos not being blocked:**
- Verify your allowed topics are set correctly
- Check if strict mode is enabled for more aggressive filtering
- Try adding more specific keywords for your allowed content
- Wait for AI models to load on first use (may take a moment)

**AI models not loading:**
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for initial model download
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Try refreshing the page if models fail to load
- Extension will automatically fall back to keyword matching if AI fails

### Performance Tips

- **Topic Optimization**: Use 3-7 well-chosen topics for best results
- **First Load**: AI models download on first use - subsequent loads are instant
- **Browser Performance**: Extension is optimized for minimal resource usage
- **Model Caching**: AI models are cached locally for fast repeated use
