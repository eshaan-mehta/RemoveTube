## üîß Technical Details

### Content Analysis Methods

1. **AI Classification** (with API key):
   - Uses Facebook's BART-large-mnli model via Hugging Face
   - Analyzes video title and description
   - Provides confidence scores for filtering decisions

2. **Keyword Matching** (fallback):
   - Simple but effective keyword-based filtering
   - Works offline without external API calls
   - Matches topics against video titles and descriptions

### Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: All settings stored locally in Chrome's storage
- **No Data Collection**: Extension doesn't collect or transmit personal data
- **API Usage**: Hugging Face API only receives video titles/descriptions for classification
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for transparency

## üìä Statistics & Insights

Track your productivity with built-in statistics:

- **Daily Counts**: Videos blocked and allowed today
- **Total Counts**: Lifetime statistics
- **Streak Counter**: Days of consistent usage
- **Topic Insights**: See which topics are most commonly matched

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Strict vs. Relaxed Mode

- **Strict Mode**: Blocks videos when classification confidence is low
- **Relaxed Mode**: Allows videos with uncertain classification
- **Recommendation**: Start with strict mode, adjust based on your needs

### Custom Topic Strategies

- **Broad Topics**: Use general terms like "education" for wider coverage
- **Specific Topics**: Use precise terms like "JavaScript programming" for focused filtering
- **Multiple Approaches**: Combine both broad and specific topics for balanced filtering

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not working on YouTube:**
- Refresh the YouTube page after installation
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Ensure you've completed the initial setup

**Videos not being blocked:**
- Verify your allowed topics are set correctly
- Check if strict mode is enabled for more aggressive filtering
- Try adding more specific keywords for your allowed content

**API key not working:**
- Ensure your Hugging Face API key is valid and active
- Check your API usage limits on Hugging Face dashboard
- The extension will fall back to keyword matching if API fails

### Performance Tips

- **Topic Optimization**: Use 3-7 well-chosen topics for best results
- **API Limits**: Monitor your Hugging Face API usage to avoid rate limits
- **Browser Performance**: The extension is lightweight but processes each video page load
